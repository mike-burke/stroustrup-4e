_Describe the difference between dynamic (run-time) and static (compile-time) type checking and outline the strengths and weaknesses of each._

*Run-time type checking* - type checking happens during program execution. This reduces the amount of syntax needed in code (to tell the compiler what's there) and so can make code more concise. It also allows for singly defined containers and algorithms - no need for statically generated templates - just pass objects around and figure it out on the fly. The downside is that there's much greater scope for programmer error, and those errors either have to be detected through unit testing, code linters or other types of analysis. Type errors at runtime are generally very difficult to recover from and may not even be detected (leading to subtle data corruption issues).

*Compile-time type checking* - type checking is done by the compiler. Errors are caught much earlier and fixed much more cheaply. The price to pay is 'more syntax' to tell the compiler what's happening (having to be more explicit with intent). The advantages are that a whole class of errors is caught up-front and that more sophisticated static analysis tools can be built to detect problems and analyze code intent.
