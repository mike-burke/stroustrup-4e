_List three (or more) advantages from having a library as part of the standard._

Advantages:
* availability of functionality across all platforms for which a compiler exists
* a greater number of eyes and brains focused on the design and implementation of those libraries
* a larger ecosystem of documentation, training and support around the use of those libraries
* a corpus of 'good practice' that can be used by other engineers to understand idioms and styles
* provides a foundation that can be used to further extend the standard libraries over time
