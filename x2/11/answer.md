_From ยง1.3 pick five suggestions that to you looks most likely to help improve your programming style._

1. Don't overabstract - don't generalize, introduce class hierarchies or parameterize beyond obvious needs.
2. Use move semantics to avoid copying large objects.
3. Use unique_ptr to reference objects of polymorphic type.
4. Use the C++ library as a teacher of new techniques and programming styles.
5. Use freestanding functions to minimize coupling and use namespaces to limit the scope of freestanding functions.
