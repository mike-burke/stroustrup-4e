*When first reading this chapter, keep a record of information that was new or surprising to you. Later, use that list to focus your further studies.*

* type sizes are expressed in units of char
* type sizes will differ by platform
* { } initialization prevents truncating conversion ```int i = {7.2}``` will fail
* Prefer ++x to x++
* Arrays can be initialzed per ``` int[] x = {1,2,3,4,5} ```
* nullptr should be used for null checks
* Classes can be initialized via ``` Constructor(x,y,z) : X {x}, Y {y}, Z {z}```
* Enum classes should be used instead of enum
* static_assert can be used for compile-time assertions
