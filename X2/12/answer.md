_Make a "top-ten list" of helpful design and programming rules. Hint: Â§X.2._

1. Don't abstract more than necessary to solve the problems you actually have.
2. Model the problem in the code using the type system and syntax available.
3. Understand the libraries available so you avoid wheel reinvention.
4. Value concision - the smaller the program, the smaller the risk of bugs.
5. Leverage RAII and stack-based storage to the greatest extent possible
6. Use the type system to catch as many errors as possible at compile-time.
7. Ensure that independent concepts are not coupled in terms of implementation.
8. Don't obsess over knowing every nook and cranny of a language.
9. Don't try to be clever - simplicity is sophistication.
10. Don't apply techniques from one language directly to another - learn and follow the idioms and style unique to each.
